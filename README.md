# Diary (for Rimworld)

![Alt text](https://github.com/AamuLumi/Rimworld-Diary/blob/master/About/Preview.png)

Write, read and export your colony's tales.

Diary adds a new tab to keep a trace of each of your colony's days.
You can write freely what happened during these days, and export the whole diary to a simple text file to share with
anyone.

## Features

- Read and write your diary for each day of your colony.
- Check events happening every day.
- Export to a single .txt, .rtf or .html file, with automatic and configurable export.
- Fully optional integration of [Progress Renderer](https://github.com/Lanilor/Progress-Renderer) : you can consult each
  map capture directly in your Diary. Captures are zoomable and movable.
- Can automatically write social interactions or events in your Diary (see mod settings).

## Compatibility

- Rimworld 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4 (should work for previous version, but not tested).
- Can be added to an existing save.
- Optional : **Progress Renderer** : MUST BE PLACED BEFORE DIARY if you want to use it.
- **For RimWar users** : if you want to have too much data in your Diary, you can place Diary after RimWar in the Mods
  window and Diary will ignore hidden events from RimWar.
